# websysproject

To get this up and running you need to do a few things. 
Assuming Ubuntu - instal MySQL server:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
And choose a password for the root user as it installs.

Install php:
sudo apt-get install php5-common libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cli

Install this - fixes some error I kept getting:
sudo apt-get -y install php5-mysql

Make a database in mysql -
Run this:
mysql -u root -pWHATEVERPASSWORDYOUCHOSE

Once in mysql run this:
CREATE DATABASE websysproject;
(dont forget the semicolon)

Install composer:
https://getcomposer.org/
run this after composer has downloaded:
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

edit your linux PATH. To do this edit .bashrc in your home directory and add these two lines
PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
export PATH

Save the .bashrc file and restart your terminal window.

Install Laravel with:
composer global require "laravel/installer"

Clone this repo with
git clone https://github.com/xRokco/websysproject.git

This will create the websysproject folder in your home directory (assuming you ran the clone from your home directory.

now create a file in the websysproject folder called .env
Copy the contents of .env.example which is in the websysproject folder into .env and edit these lines:
DB_DATABASE=websysproject  //your database name, created as websysproject up above
DB_USERNAME=root          //database username, root will do here
DB_PASSWORD=WHATEVERPASSWORDYOUCHOSE //password chose when you installed mysql

Save and close .env

Next make sure you are in the websysproject folder and run:
php artisan migrate

This creates the db tables if the details in .env are correct.
Next run this:
php artisan key:generate

Project should be up and running now. Run this to start it up:
php artisan serve

Now you can go to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser to test and develope on your web app.
